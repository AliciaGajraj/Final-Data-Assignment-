    <p> The pandemic affected so many businesses in New York City, specifically food service establishments. These establishments were forced to close down because of the rising infection rates. However, to keep their business afloat, many food service establishments

        implemented outdoor dining. </p>

      <p> Now, New York City is filled with outdoor dinning options in different boroughs. Customers have the option to either sit inside or outside under certain restrictions. </p>

      <p> According to the New York City Department of Transportation,
        "establishments seeking to utilize additional public sidewalk or roadway space for outdoor dining operation must apply online
        at <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/pedestrians/openrestaurants.shtml"> nyc.gov/openrestaurants </a> and may
        commerce upon self-certification." The Open Resaurant Application was proposed in June 2020 to help food service establishments. Under Phase Two of New York Forward plan, it allowed food service establishments to utilize any privately owned
    outdoor space, such as front yards, or courtyards, open air roof top space, balconies, terraces, private parking lots, etc. It was
  specifically designed for food services to apply for sidewalk access, roadway access or both. </p>

<p> Andrea Strong, the executive director for <a href="https://www.roarnewyork.org"> ROARny</a> , fights for unemployed restaurant workers and their rights when facing financial hardships.
  "We made sure that outdoor dinning was made permanent, which meant that restaurants were going to be able to employ their restaurant workers
  for the winter," Strong said. </p>
